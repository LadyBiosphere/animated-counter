#Animated number counter
===================================
###### Updated: Friday the 12th of January 2018.


### Overview
This project focuses on creating a counting animation; the counting will begin from 0 and then rapidly climb up and stop at a specified number. It's a cute piece of UI design that's ideal for displaying statistical data.

### Requirements
To get the most out of this project, it is assumed that you already know how to do all of the following: 
- how to create HTML DIVs, classes, and ID's
- how to create responsive layouts using CSS (I've used flexbox but you use floats or a framework)
- how to write JavaScript (in particular, jQuery)
- how to recognise JavaScript errors using your browser's console

### Resources

[Google hosted libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)
 provides a range of CDN's, including the latest version of jQuery.

[jquery.com](http://jquery.com/)
 provides excellent documentation about jQuery. There is also a section where you can find more information about 'no conflict' mode.
